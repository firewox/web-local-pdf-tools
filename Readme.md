# Local PDF Tools

English | [ä¸­æ–‡](README_CN.md)

This is a PDF processing tool that runs entirely in your browser. It provides three main features:
- **Split PDF**: Extract specific page ranges from a PDF document.
- **Merge PDF**: Combine multiple PDF files into a single document.
- **Compress PDF**: Reduce PDF file size while maintaining quality.
- **Parse PDF**: Extract text content from PDF documents.
- **Advanced Parse PDF**: Use OCR to extract images, metadata, and other structured information.

## Context

This project is a PDF processing tool based on modern Web technology, focused on providing efficient and reliable document processing capabilities. Through pure browser-side implementation, it provides users with core functions such as PDF splitting, merging, compression, and text extraction. Thanks to the cutting-edge Web technology stack, all operations are performed locally, ensuring the security of your document data.

Say goodbye to the complexity and bloat of traditional PDF software (goodbye, WPS, Microsoft Office, and Adobe Acrobat ðŸ‘‹), we pursue a lightweight and elegant tool philosophy. No installation required, no forced subscriptions, no popup distractions - this is what modern tools should look like. Let's use the power of technology to redefine the minimalist beauty of PDF processing tools. ðŸš€

## Web Worker

The compression is now processed in a web worker so that the main thread doesn't become unresponsive and now there is virtually no limit to the size of the PDF that you can compress :tada:
