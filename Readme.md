# Local PDF Tools

This web app is a PDF processing tool that runs entirely in your browser using Ghostscript WebAssembly. It provides three main features:
- **Compress**: Reduce PDF file size while maintaining quality
- **Merge**: Combine multiple PDF files into a single document  
- **Split**: Extract specific page ranges from a PDF document

## Context

This project is a demo of another usage of the `gs.wasm` that [@ochachacha](https://github.com/ochachacha) compiled and [ghostscript-pdf-compress.wasm](https://github.com/laurentmmeyer/ghostscript-pdf-compress.wasm). It takes any PDF and compress it via ghostscript.

The applied command is:

```
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dDownsampleColorImages=true -dColorImageResolution=150 -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=output.pdf input.pdf
```

## WebWorker

The compression is now processed in a webworker so that the main thread doesn't become unresponsive and now there is virtually no limit to the size of the PDF that you can compress :tada:
